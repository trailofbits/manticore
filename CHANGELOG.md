### Major Changes
##### Executor Refactor ([#1385](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/pull/1385))
We've completed a major refactor of the core executor that reorganizes Manticore's state machine to be more amenable toward use with the multiprocesssing module. This refactor introduces some small API changes:
* One must explicitly call the `finalize` method to dump test cases from a run
* The `will_start_run` event has been renamed to `will_run`
* The `solver` module requires explicitly accessing the Z3Solver singleton. `from manticore.core.smtlib import solver` becomes:
```python
from manticore.core.smtlib.solver import Z3Solver
solver = Z3Solver.instance()
```
* `manticore.running_states` has been renamed to `manticore._busy_states`
For more information about changes to the state machine, see [the diagram in core/manticore.py](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/blob/451965f03a5e0d6766e499bf3246e4796b35638f/manticore/core/manticore.py#L132-L239)

##### Blacken ([#1438](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/pull/1438))
We've run the [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) autoformatter on the master branch of Manticore, and added a check for compliance to our CI. To ensure your code is properly formatted, run `black -t py36 -l 100 .` in your Manticore directory before committing. 

##### Support for statically-linked AArch64 binaries ([#1424](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/pull/1424))
Contractor [nkaretnikov](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/commits?author=nkaretnikov) spent several months adding support for AArch64 on Linux. As this is a brand new architecture, we've left in most of the debugging assertions, which may slow it down slightly. 
We look forward to getting feedback on this architecture so we can eventually remove the debugging assertions. 


### Ethereum

* Added Symbolic EVM Tests for the Frontier fork. Note that we don't support any other forks (i.e. Constantinople) yet. ([#1431](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/pull/1431), [#1441](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/pull/1441))

## 0.2.4 - 2019-01-10

### Ethereum

* **[added API]** Fixed VerboseTrace plugin ([#1305](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/pull/1305)) and added VerboseTraceStdout plugin  ([#1305](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/pull/1305)): those can be used to track EVM execution (`m.regiser_plugin(VerboseTraceStdout())`)
* **[changed API]** Made gas calculation faithfulness configurable: this way, you can choose whether you respect or ignore gas calculations with `--evm.oog <opt>` (see `--help`); also, the gas calculations has been decoupled into its own methods ([#1279](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/pull/1279))
* **[changed API]** Changed default gas to 3000000 when creating contract ([#1332](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/pull/1332))

* **[changed API]** The `stdin_size` CLI argument has been moved to config constant and so has to be passed using `--native.stdin_size` instead of `--stdin_size` ([#1337](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/pull/1337))
* Speeded up Armv7 execution a bit ([#1313](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/pull/1313))

## 0.2.3 - 2018-12-11

Thanks to our external contributors!

- [PetarMI](https://github.com/PetarMI)
- [hidde-jan](https://github.com/hidde-jan)
- [catenacyber](https://github.com/catenacyber)

### Added

- Support for ARM THUMB instructions: ADR, ADDW, SUBW, CBZ, TBB, TBH, STMDA, STMDB
- `State.solve_minmax()` API for querying a BitVec for its min/max values
- New SMTLIB optimization for simplifying redundant concat/extract combinations; helps reduce expression complexity, and speed up queries
- Ethereum: `--txpreconstrain` CLI flag. Enabling this avoids sending ether to nonpayable functions, primarily avoiding exploration of uninteresting revert states.
- Research memory model (LazySMemory) allowing for symbolic memory indexing to be handled without concretization (opt in, currently for research only)

### Changed

- Linux/binary analysis has been moved to `manticore.native`, `manticore.core.cpu` has been moved to `manticore.native.cpu`. Please update your imports.
- The binary analysis dependencies are now not installed by default. They can be installed with `pip install manticore[native]`. This is to prevent EVM users from installing binary dependencies.
- The symbolic `stdin_size` is now a config variable (in `main` config group) with a default of 256 (it was like this before).
- `ManticoreEVM.generate_testcase()` 'name' parameter is now optional
- Manticore CLI run on a smart contract will now use all detectors by default (detectors can be listed with --list-detectors, excluded with --exclude <detectors> or --exclude-all)
- Misusing the ManticoreEVM API, for example by using old keyword arguments that are not available since some versions (like ManticoreEVM(verbosity=5)) will now raise an exception instead of not applying the argument at all.

### Fixed

- Ethereum: Fixed CLI timeout support
- Numerous EVM correctness fixes for Frontier fork
- Fixed handling of default storage and memory in EVM (reading from previously unused cell will return a zero now)
- ARM THUMB mode, Linux syscall emulation fixes
- Creation of multiple contracts with symbolic arguments (ManticoreEVM.solidity_create_contract with args=None fired more than once failed before)

### Removed

- `Manticore.evm` static method

## 0.2.2 - 2018-10-30

- [stephan-tolksdorf](https://github.com/stephan-tolksdorf)
- [catenacyber](https://github.com/catenacyber)
- [MJ10](https://github.com/MJ10)

### Added

- New API for generating a testcase only if a certain condition can be true in the state. Useful for conveniently
  checking an invariant in a state, and  (`ManticoreEVM.generate_testcase(..., only_if=)`) generating a testcase if it
  can be violated.
- New `constrain=` optional parameter for `State.solve_one` and `State.solve_buffer`. After solving for a symbolic variable,
  mutate the state by applying that solution as a constraint. Useful if concretizing a few symbolic variables, and later
  concretizations should take into account previously solved for values.
- `ManticoreEVM.human_transactions` top level API. Mirrors `ManticoreEVM.transactions`, but does not contain any internal
  transactions.
- Emit generated transaction data in human readable format (JSON)
- Warning messages if number of passed arguments to a Solidity function is inconsistent with the number declared
- CLI support for the ReentrancyAdvancedDetector
- Colored CLI output
- Configuration system. Allows configuration options to be specified in a config file. New configurations are available,
  notably including solver parameters such as solver timeout, and memory limits.
- Support for some unimplemented x86 XMM instructions
- Customizable symbolic stdin input buffer size
- Support for [Etheno](https://github.com/trailofbits/etheno)
- `RaceConditionDetector` that can be used to detect transaction order dependencies bugs

### Changed

- Improve the DetectExternalCallAndLeak detector and reduce false positives
- Numerous improvements and changes to the SolidityMetadata API
- Ethereum contract addresses are no longer random, but are deterministically calculated according to the Yellow Paper
- Manticore no longer supports contracts with symbolic addresses creating new contracts. This is a consequence of
  supporting determinstic contrat address calculation. There are plans for reenabling this capability in a future release.

### Deprecated

- Several SolidityMetadata APIs: `.get_hash()`, `.functions`, `.hashes`

### Fixed

- Numerous fixes and enhancements to the Ethereum ABI implementation
- Better handling of overloaded functions in SolidityMetadata, and other bug fixes
- Fixes for the FilterFunctions plugin
- Fixes for symbolic SHA3 handling
- Many EVM correctness/consensus fixes
- Numerous spelling errors

## 0.2.1.1 - 2018-09-01

In this release, the codebase has been relicensed under the AGPLv3 license.
Please [contact us](opensource@trailofbits.com) if you're looking for an exception to these terms!

Thanks to our external contributors!

- [s0b0lev](https://github.com/s0b0lev)
- [redyoshi49q](https://github.com/redyoshi49q)

### Added
 
- Full suite of Ethereum detectors
    - Selfdestruct (`--detect-selfdestruct`): Warns if a selfdestruct instruction is reachable by the user
    - Ether Leak (`--detect-externalcall`): Warns if there is a call to the user, or a user controlled address, and ether can be sent.
    - External Call (`--detect-externalcall`): Warns if there is a call to the user, or a user controlled address.
    - Reentrancy (`--detect-reentrancy`): Warns if there is a change of storage state after a call to the user, or a user controlled address, with >2300 gas. This is an alternate implementation enabled in the CLI. The previous implementation is still available for API use (`DetectReentrancyAdvanced`).
    - Delegatecall (`--detect-delegatecall`): Warns if there is a delegatecall to a user controlled address, or to a user controlled function.
    - Environmental Instructions (`--detect-env`): Warns if certain instructions are used that can be potentially manipulated. Instructions: BLOCKHASH, COINBASE, TIMESTAMP, NUMBER, DIFFICULTY, GASLIMIT, ORIGIN, GASPRICE.
- New Ethereum command line flags
    - `--no-testcases`: Do not generate testcases for discovered states
    - `--txnoether`: Do not make the transaction value symbolic in executed transactions
- SMTLIB: Advanced functionality for expression migration. Expressions from arbitrary constraint sets can be mixed to create arbitrary constraints, expressions are transparently migrated from constraint set to another, avoiding SMT naming collisions.
 
### Changed

- Command line interface uses new reentrancy detector based on detection of user controlled call addresses
 
### Fixed

- Ethereum: Support for overloaded solidity functions
- Ethereum: Significantly improved ability to create symbolic variables and constraints at the global level
- Ethereum: Improved gas support

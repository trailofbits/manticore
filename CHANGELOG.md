# Change Log

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/compare/0.2.2...HEAD)

### Changed

- Linux/binary analysis has been moved to `manticore.native`, `manticore.core.cpu` has been moved to `manticore.native.cpu`. Please update your imports.
- The binary analysis dependencies are now not installed by default. They can be installed with `pip install manticore[native]`.
- The symbolic `stdin_size` is now a config variable (in `main` config group) with a default of 256 (it was like this before).


### Removed
- `Manticore.evm` static method

## 0.2.2 - 2018-10-30

- [catenacyber](https://github.com/catenacyber)
- [MJ10](https://github.com/MJ10)

### Added

- New API for generating a testcase only if a certain condition can be true in the state. Useful for conveniently
  checking an invariant in a state, and  (`ManticoreEVM.generate_testcase(..., only_if=)`) generating a testcase if it
  can be violated.
- New `constrain=` optional parameter for `State.solve_one` and `State.solve_buffer`. After solving for a symbolic variable,
  mutate the state by applying that solution as a constraint. Useful if concretizing a few symbolic variables, and later
  concretizations should take into account previously solved for values.
- `ManticoreEVM.human_transactions` top level API. Mirrors `ManticoreEVM.transactions`, but does not contain any internal
  transactions.
- Emit generated transaction data in human readable format (JSON)
- Warning messages if number of passed arguments to a Solidity function is inconsistent with the number declared
- CLI support for the ReentrancyAdvancedDetector
- Colored CLI output
- Configuration system. Allows configuration options to be specified in a config file. New configurations are available,
  notably including solver parameters such as solver timeout, and memory limits.
- Support for some unimplemented x86 XMM instructions
- Customizable symbolic stdin input buffer size
- Support for [Etheno](https://github.com/trailofbits/etheno)
- `RaceConditionDetector` that can be used to detect transaction order dependencies bugs

### Changed

- Improve the DetectExternalCallAndLeak detector and reduce false positives
- Numerous improvements and changes to the SolidityMetadata API
- Ethereum contract addresses are no longer random, but are deterministically calculated according to the Yellow Paper
- Manticore no longer supports contracts with symbolic addresses creating new contracts. This is a consequence of
  supporting determinstic contrat address calculation. There are plans for reenabling this capability in a future release.

### Deprecated

- Several SolidityMetadata APIs: `.get_hash()`, `.functions`, `.hashes`

### Fixed

- Numerous fixes and enhancements to the Ethereum ABI implementation
- Better handling of overloaded functions in SolidityMetadata, and other bug fixes
- Fixes for the FilterFunctions plugin
- Fixes for symbolic SHA3 handling
- Many EVM correctness/consensus fixes
- Numerous spelling errors

## 0.2.1.1 - 2018-09-01

### Added
 
- Full suite of Ethereum detectors
    - Selfdestruct (`--detect-selfdestruct`): Warns if a selfdestruct instruction is reachable by the user
    - Ether Leak (`--detect-externalcall`): Warns if there is a call to the user, or a user controlled address, and ether can be sent.
    - External Call (`--detect-externalcall`): Warns if there is a call to the user, or a user controlled address.
    - Reentrancy (`--detect-reentrancy`): Warns if there is a change of storage state after a call to the user, or a user controlled address, with >2300 gas. This is an alternate implementation enabled in the CLI. The previous implementation is still available for API use (`DetectReentrancyAdvanced`).
    - Delegatecall (`--detect-delegatecall`): Warns if there is a delegatecall to a user controlled address, or to a user controlled function.
    - Environmental Instructions (`--detect-env`): Warns if certain instructions are used that can be potentially manipulated. Instructions: BLOCKHASH, COINBASE, TIMESTAMP, NUMBER, DIFFICULTY, GASLIMIT, ORIGIN, GASPRICE.
- New Ethereum command line flags
    - `--no-testcases`: Do not generate testcases for discovered states
    - `--txnoether`: Do not make the transaction value symbolic in executed transactions
- SMTLIB: Advanced functionality for expression migration. Expressions from arbitrary constraint sets can be mixed to create arbitrary constraints, expressions are transparently migrated from constraint set to another, avoiding SMT naming collisions.
 
### Changed

- Command line interface uses new reentrancy detector based on detection of user controlled call addresses
 
### Fixed

- Ethereum: Support for overloaded solidity functions
- Ethereum: Significantly improved ability to create symbolic variables and constraints at the global level
- Ethereum: Improved gas support
- State serialization improvements and fixes

## 0.2.0 - 2018-08-10

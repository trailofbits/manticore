# Contributing to Manticore

First, thanks for your interest in contributing to Manticore! We welcome and
appreciate all contributions, including bug reports, feature suggestions,
tutorials/blog posts, and code improvements.

If you're unsure where to start, we recommend our `easy` and `help-wanted`
labels.

## Bug reports and feature suggestions

All of these can be submitted to our [issue
tracker](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/issues).  If you find a
security vulnerability, do not open an issue; email opensource@trailofbits.com
instead.

## Questions

Questions can be submitted to the issue tracker, but you may get a faster
response if you ask in our [chat room](https://empireslacking.herokuapp.com/)
(in the #manticore channel).

## Code

Manticore uses the pull request contribution model. Please make an account on
github, fork this repo, and submit code contributions via pull request. For
more documentation, look [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

Some pull request guidelines:

- Minimize irrelevant changes (formatting, whitespace, etc) to code that would
  otherwise not be touched by this patch. Save formatting or style corrections
  for a separate pull request that does not make any semantic changes.
- When possible, large changes should be split up into smaller focused pull
  requests.
- Fill out the pull request description with a summary of what your patch does,
  key changes that have been made, and any further points of discussion, if
  applicable.

### Development Environment

Instructions for installing a development version of Manticore can be found in

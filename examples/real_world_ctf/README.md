# Real-World CTF Challenges Solved with Manticore

This directory contains solutions to actual Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges that were solved using Manticore. These examples demonstrate the practical application of symbolic execution to solve real security challenges.

## Why These Examples Matter

These aren't just theoretical demonstrations - they are actual solutions to challenges from security competitions and bug bounty programs. They show:

1. **Real Problem Solving**: How security researchers use Manticore in practice
2. **Technique Demonstration**: Various symbolic execution techniques and strategies
3. **API Usage**: Real-world usage patterns of Manticore's API
4. **Success Stories**: Proof that Manticore can solve complex challenges

## Available Challenges

### üî∑ Ethereum/Smart Contract Challenges

#### [PolySwarm Challenge](./polyswarm_challenge/)
- **Type**: Smart Contract Reverse Engineering
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Techniques**: Symbolic buffer analysis, EVM bytecode analysis
- **Description**: Find the magic input bytes that satisfy a smart contract's checks
- **Key Learning**: How to use symbolic execution to reverse engineer smart contract logic

### üñ•Ô∏è Binary Reverse Engineering Challenges

#### [Google CTF 2016: Unbreakable](./google2016_unbreakable/)
- **Type**: Binary Reverse Engineering
- **Platform**: Linux x86_64
- **Difficulty**: Medium-Hard
- **Techniques**: Symbolic execution, constraint solving, execution hooks
- **Description**: Find the product activation key that passes complex validation
- **Key Learning**: Bypassing complex algorithms without manual reverse engineering

## How to Use These Examples

Each challenge directory contains:
- The original challenge files (binaries, contracts, etc.)
- A Python script showing the Manticore solution
- Documentation explaining the approach
- Comments highlighting key techniques

### Running an Example

```bash
# Navigate to a challenge directory
cd polyswarm_challenge

# Run the solution
python polyswarm_challenge.py
```

### As Test Cases

These examples also serve as integration tests:

```bash
# Run all CTF examples as tests
python -m pytest test_real_world_ctf.py -v
```

## Learning Path

If you're new to Manticore, we recommend studying these examples in this order:

1. **Google CTF 2016: Unbreakable** - Start here for binary symbolic execution basics
2. **PolySwarm Challenge** - Move to smart contract analysis
3. (More challenges will be added)

## Contributing

Have you solved a CTF challenge using Manticore? We'd love to include it here! 

Requirements for contributions:
1. The challenge should be publicly available or have permission to share
2. Include the original challenge files
3. Provide a well-commented solution script
4. Add documentation explaining your approach
5. Ensure the solution works with current Manticore

## Note on Ethics

These solutions are provided for educational purposes. If you're participating in an active CTF:
- Don't use these solutions to cheat in ongoing competitions
- Learn the techniques and apply them yourself
- Give credit if you adapt these approaches

Remember: The goal is to learn symbolic execution techniques, not to copy solutions!

PolySwarm Smart Contract Hacking Challenge Solution using Manticore

This is a real-world example of using Manticore to solve a CTF challenge.
The PolySwarm challenge involved finding the correct input to bypass a smart contract check.

Challenge Description:
- The WinnerLog contract has a logWinner function that checks input data
- The goal is to find the magic bytes that will pass the check
- The contract contains the string "dogecointothemoonlambosoondudes!" which is a hint

Original Author: Raz0r (me@raz0r.name)
Writeup: https://raz0r.name/writeups/polyswarm-smart-contract-hacking-challenge-writeup/

NOTE: This example currently fails due to invalid contract bytecode in winnerlog.bin.
      The bytecode file appears to contain test data instead of actual EVM bytecode.
      Use polyswarm_simplified.py for a working demonstration of the technique.

      See issue #2676 for details: https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/issues/2676

This example demonstrates:
- Setting up accounts with specific addresses
- Deploying contracts from bytecode
- Creating symbolic buffers
- Using Manticore to find inputs that satisfy contract conditions

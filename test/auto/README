Auto unittest generation
------------------------

1) You need a linux program that exercises a bunch of interestings intructions. 
Lets choose:
    SymbolicExecutor/examples/linux/nostdlib

2) Run the tracer on it. It is a gdb wrapper that will execute the program step by step 
printing pre/pos information on each instruction:
    python SymbolicExecutor/tests/auto/make_dump.py SymbolicExecutor/examples/linux/nostdlib > mytest.dump
(Several dump can be concatenated togheter)

3) Generate the alcual python unittest based on the dump. 
    python SymbolicExecutor/tests/auto/make_tests.py mytest.dump > SymbolicExecutor/tests/test_$TESTNAME.py
   This will get up to 1000 testcases for the same mnemonic in the dump. 

4) Run the test like this (SymbolicExecutor/)
    python -m unittest -c tests.test_$TESTNAME

# This file is execfile()d with the current directory set to its

# All configuration values have a default; values that are commented out
# serve to show the default.

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

# -- Custom

# our setup.py does not install z3-solver when on rtd because
# for some reason z3 is built during the dep install process,
# and rtd ooms (something related to `python setup.py --force`)

# so because z3-solver is not installed as a dep, but
# rtd still does `import manticore`, we need to mock the environment
# enough to make Manticore importable. specifically, we need to mock
# things so a Z3Solver can be constructed.

Function Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Manticore function modeling API can be used to override a certain
function in the target program with a custom implementation in Python.
This can greatly increase performance.

Manticore comes with implementations of function models for some common library routines (core models),
and also offers a user API for defining user-defined models.

To use a core model, use the :meth:`~manticore.native.state.State.invoke_model` API. The
available core models are documented in the API Reference::

    from manticore.native.models import strcmp
    addr_of_strcmp = 0x400510
    @m.hook(addr_of_strcmp)
    def strcmp_model(state):
        state.invoke_model(strcmp)

To implement a user-defined model, implement your model as a Python function, and pass it to
:meth:`~manticore.native.state.State.invoke_model`. See the
:meth:`~manticore.native.state.State.invoke_model` documentation for more. The
`core models <https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/blob/master/manticore/models.py>`_
are also good examples to look at and use the same external user API.

Symbolic Input
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Manticore allows you to execute programs with symbolic input, which represents a range of possible inputs. You
can do this in a variety of manners.

**Wildcard byte**

Throughout these various interfaces, the '+' character is defined to designate a byte
of input as symbolic. This allows the user to make input that mixes symbolic and concrete
bytes (e.g. known file magic bytes).

For example: ``"concretedata++++++++moreconcretedata++++++++++"``

**Symbolic arguments/environment**

To provide a symbolic argument or environment variable on the command line,
use the wildcard byte where arguments and environment are specified.::

    $ manticore ./binary +++++ +++++
    $ manticore ./binary --env VAR1=+++++ --env VAR2=++++++

For API use, use the ``argv`` and ``envp`` arguments to the :meth:`manticore.native.Manticore.linux` classmethod.::

    Manticore.linux('./binary', ['++++++', '++++++'], dict(VAR1='+++++', VAR2='++++++'))

**Symbolic stdin**

Manticore by default is configured with 256 bytes of symbolic stdin data which is configurable
with the ``stdin_size`` kwarg of :meth:`manticore.native.Manticore.linux` , after an optional
concrete data prefix, which can be provided with the ``concrete_start`` kwarg of
:meth:`manticore.native.Manticore.linux`.

**Symbolic file input**

To provide symbolic input from a file, first create the files that will be opened by the
analyzed program, and fill them with wildcard bytes where you would like symbolic data
to be.

.. warning::
   **Known Limitation**: Symbolic files currently only work with programs that read files using 
   direct syscalls (``read``, ``write``, etc.). Programs using libc buffered I/O functions 
   (``fopen``, ``fread``, ``getline``, etc.) are not supported due to incompatibility between 
   Manticore's SymbolicFile objects and libc's FILE* structures. See `issue #2672 
   <https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/issues/2672>`_ for technical details.

For command line use, invoke Manticore with the ``--file`` argument.::

    $ manticore ./binary --file my_symbolic_file1.txt --file my_symbolic_file2.txt

For API use, use the :meth:`~manticore.platforms.linux.SLinux.add_symbolic_file` interface to customize the initial
execution state from an :meth:`~manticore.core.manticore.ManticoreBase.__init__`

.. code-block:: Python

    @m.init
    def init(initial_state):
        initial_state.platform.add_symbolic_file('my_symbolic_file1.txt')

**Symbolic sockets**

Manticore's socket support is experimental! Sockets are configured to contain 64 bytes of
symbolic input.

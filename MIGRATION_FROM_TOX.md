# Migration from tox.ini - COMPLETED âœ…

This document describes the migration from tox.ini to pyproject.toml that has been completed.

## What Was Done

### 1. Switched from flake8 to ruff
- Ruff is a modern, fast linter that natively supports pyproject.toml
- All flake8 ignore rules have been converted to ruff format
- Configuration is now in `[tool.ruff]` section of pyproject.toml

### 2. Removed tox.ini
- The tox.ini file has been removed from the repository
- Multi-Python version testing is handled by GitHub Actions matrix

## Configuration Changes

### Old (tox.ini):
```ini
[flake8]
ignore = E265,E501,F403,F405,E266,E712,F841,E741,E722,E731
max-line-length = 100
exclude = .tox,.*.egg,.git,docs/,examples/,scripts/,tests/,iterpickle.py
```

### New (pyproject.toml):
```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 100
exclude = [".tox", "*.egg", ".git", "docs/", "examples/", "scripts/", "tests/", "iterpickle.py", "venv/", "server/"]

[tool.ruff.lint]
ignore = [
    "E265",  # Block comment should start with '# '
    "E501",  # Line too long (handled by line-length)
    "F403",  # 'from module import *' used
    "F405",  # Name may be undefined from star imports
    "E266",  # Too many leading '#' for block comment
    "E712",  # Comparison to True/False should be with is/is not
    "F841",  # Local variable assigned but never used
    "E741",  # Ambiguous variable name
    "E722",  # Do not use bare except
    "E731",  # Do not assign a lambda expression
    "F401",  # Unused imports
    "E402",  # Module import not at top of file
]
```

## Commands

### Before (with tox):
```bash
tox -e py311      # Test with Python 3.11
tox -e pep8       # Run flake8
```

### After (with pyproject.toml):
```bash
pytest -n auto tests  # Run tests
ruff check .         # Lint code
ruff format .        # Format code (replaces black)
black --check .      # Check formatting
mypy .              # Type check
```

## Multi-Python Version Testing

GitHub Actions CI matrix already tests across Python 3.8-3.12, so tox is no longer needed for this purpose.

## Benefits of This Migration

1. **Single configuration file**: All Python tooling configuration is now in pyproject.toml
2. **Faster linting**: Ruff is 10-100x faster than flake8
3. **Modern tooling**: Ruff is actively maintained and includes many improvements
4. **Better IDE support**: pyproject.toml is well-supported by modern IDEs
5. **Simpler maintenance**: No need to maintain separate tox.ini file

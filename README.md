Manticore is a prototyping tool for dynamic binary analysis, with support for symbolic execution, taint analysis, and binary instrumentation.

## Features

- **Input Generation**: Manticore automatically generates inputs that trigger unique code paths
- **Crash Discovery**: Manticore discovers inputs that crash programs via memory safety violations
- **Execution Tracing**: Manticore records an instruction-level trace of execution for each generated input
- **Programmatic Interface**: Manticore exposes programmatic access to its analysis engine via a Python API

Manticore supports binaries of the following formats, operating systems, and
architectures. It has been primarily used on binaries compiled from C and C++.
Examples of practical manticore usage are also [on github](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore-examples).

- OS/Formats: Linux ELF
- Architectures: x86, x86_64, ARMv7

## Requirements

Manticore is supported on Linux, and requires Python 2.7 and the [Z3 Theorem Prover](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases). Ubuntu 16.04 is strongly recommended.

## Quick Start

Install and try Manticore in a few shell commands (see an [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/a/567nko3eh2yzit099s0nq4e8z)):

```
# Install system dependencies
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install z3 python-pip -y
python -m pip install -U pip

# Install manticore and its dependencies
sudo pip install manticore

# Download and build the examples
git clone https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore.git && cd manticore/examples/linux
make

# Use the Manticore CLI
manticore basic
cat mcore_*/*0.stdin | ./basic
cat mcore_*/*1.stdin | ./basic

# Use the Manticore API
cd ../script
python count_instructions.py ../linux/helloworld
```

## Installation

Make sure that Z3 is installed and available on your `PATH`. On Ubuntu, this is as simple as `sudo apt-get install z3`.

Option 1: Perform a user install (requires `~/.local/bin` in your `PATH`).

```
echo "PATH=\$PATH:~/.local/bin" >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
pip install --user manticore
```

Option 2: Use a virtual environment (requires [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [similar](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)).

```
pip install virtualenvwrapper
echo "source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh" >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
mkvirtualenv manticore
pip install manticore
```

Option 3: Perform a system install.

```
sudo pip install manticore
```

Once installed, the `manticore` CLI tool and its Python API will be available.

For installing a development version of Manticore, see our [wiki](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/wiki/Hacking-on-Manticore).

### Redis

If you'd like to use redis for state serialization (instead of disk), install
redis using your host package manager, then install manticore as above, but
with `[redis]` appended to the name of the package, e.g.

```
pip install manticore[redis]
```

Note that this does not make manticore use redis automatically, and you'll still
have to manually set the workspace to the redis URI.

## Usage

```
$ manticore ./path/to/binary        # runs, and creates a mcore_* directory with analysis results
$ manticore ./path/to/binary ab cd  # use concrete strings "ab", "cd" as program arguments
$ manticore ./path/to/binary ++ ++  # use two symbolic strings of length two as program arguments
```

or

```python
# example Manticore script
from manticore import Manticore

hook_pc = 0x400ca0

m = Manticore('./path/to/binary')

@m.hook(hook_pc)
def hook(state):
  cpu = state.cpu
  print 'eax', cpu.EAX
  print cpu.read_int(cpu.SP)

  m.terminate()  # tell Manticore to stop

m.run()
```

Further documentation is available in several places:

  * The [wiki](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/wiki) contains some
    basic information about getting started with manticore and contributing

  * The [examples](examples) directory has some very minimal examples that
    showcase API features

  * The [manticore-examples](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore-examples)
    repository has some more involved examples, for instance solving real CTF problems

  * The [API reference](http://manticore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) has more
    thorough and in-depth documentation on our API

class Worker:
    """
        A Manticore Worker.
        This will run forever potentially in a different process. Normally it
        will be spawned at Manticore constructor and will stay alive until killed.
        A Worker can be in 3 phases: STANDBY, RUNNING, KILLED. And will react to
        different events: start, stop, kill.
        The events are transmitted via 2 conditional variable: m._killed and
        m._started.

        .. code-block:: none

            STANDBY:   Waiting for the start event
            RUNNING:   Exploring and spawning states until no more READY states or
            the cancel event is received
            KIlLED:    This is the end. No more manticoring in this worker process
